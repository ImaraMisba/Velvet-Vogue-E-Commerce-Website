Velvet Vogue – Fashion E-Commerce Website

Velvet vogue is a fashion e-commerce web application built with PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, crafted to showcase essential online purchasing features. The website presents product categories for men, women and accessories, enabling users to add products to a purchasing cart, modify quantities and view a dynamic cart indicator managed through PHP sessions. It comprises a systematic cart system featuring subtotal and shipping computations, a transaction page displaying an order summary and a streamlined, contemporary user interface. This project was developed as an academic endeavor focused on acquiring practical experience in server-side development, session management and frontend formatting within a local Apache server management.
